## Turn off the .NET “terminal logger”

Use `--tl:off` avoids dynamic output and progress rendering.

```powershell
dotnet restore --tl:off -v minimal
dotnet build   --tl:off --nologo -v minimal
dotnet test    --tl:off --nologo -v minimal --no-build
```

## Definition of done

[to be completed]

## Commit hygiene

- Before every commit, review whether `AGENTS.md` needs updates for new workflows or constraints.
- After every complex commit, review the full diff and the commit content to confirm there are no accidental or irrelevant changes.

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

## Conformance tests

- Conformance scripts live under `tests/Lokad.Starlark.Tests/TestData/Conformance` (subfolders for go/java/rust) and use `---` to split independent cases.
- Inline `### (regex)` after a statement marks the expected error message for the case.
